# Dapp

App to simplify control of needed stash at home

## Briefing

This project is not a starting point for a Flutter Application.

I am giving legs to a project I designed a couple months ago while planning to 
move from my parents home, though it was just a design I took the last 3 weeks or so 
(files creation dated 29th July) to eliminate all sorts of procrastination and made it a priority 
to develop and now testing with my younger brother who is giving me insights on how we can make it better.
